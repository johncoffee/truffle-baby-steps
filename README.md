# Truffle baby steps
This is a framework for getting started with Solidity, deployment of contracts, and unit testing. Basically what Truffle 
does best.


# Running

`npm run ganache` short for `node node_modules/ganache-cli/build/cli.node.js`


# Installing 

#### Requirements
We need `node`, `npm` and `truffle` installed globally.

It worked last with truffle@4.1.14 and node v8.11.3 npm 5.6.0

#### Depedencies
`npm install`
