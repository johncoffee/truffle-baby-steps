# Truffle baby steps
This is a framework for getting started with Solidity, deployment of contracts, and unit testing. Basically what Truffle 
does best.

The approach is the same as fiveogit's [solidity-baby-steps](https://github.com/fivedogit/solidity-baby-steps)


# Running

`npm run ganache`


# Installing 

#### Requirements
We need to install `node`, `npm`, `truffle`, and `typescript` globally.

It worked last with truffle@4.1.14 and node v8.11.3 npm 5.6.0, typescript 3.0.3

#### Depedencies
`npm install`
